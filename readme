genes bed and hs37 are different genomes, but practically
only MT and decoys are different. And those don't matter here.

process:

pad genes, then try split genome into N intervals
with intervals only outside the gene regions.

chr3, Y, and MT differ.
MT is totally different - just replace with a single full region anyway
3 differs only in a few non acgt -> N places. - just ignore
Y differs in many N regions. with ucsc (genes.bed) having acgt instead of N (hs37)
    - this should be safe to ignore.
